# Car-Detection-Using-YOLOv5
Detecting cars within images. The primary goal is to develop and implement a car detection system capable of identifying and drawing bounding boxes around cars in various traffic scenes. The system is designed to work with images containing multiple vehicles and to accurately localize each car with bounding boxes.
